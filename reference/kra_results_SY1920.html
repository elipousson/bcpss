still receive a composite score and readiness level. NS is applied when an
item requires demonstration of a skill (e.g., hopping), and the child is
not able to respond due to a disability that restricts or prevents
participating in the skill being assessed. A NS rating would not be
appropriate when the response to the item reflects a child's functioning at
an earlier developmental level and their ability to respond is not affected
by a disability; in this instance the appropriate rating would be “0” since
the child could access the item, but did not demonstrate the skill. See
MSDE: KRA 2018-19 Technical Report, January 2019. Consistent with MSDE's
reporting, aggregates exclude students with some incomplete items, and
include students with not scorable (NS) items. Missing values include data
that has been suppressed due to a group size of less than 10 students.
Children whose readiness skills and behaviors are &quot;approaching&quot; or
&quot;emerging&quot; overall require instructional support to be successful in
kindergarten and beyond. Reports of KRA data prior to the 2018-19
administration have readiness level assigned for each of the four domains
(Literacy, Math, Social Foundations, and Physical Development). Since last
year's administration, readiness levels are no longer reported for
individual domains, and only an overall or composite readiness level is
reported. This is why this data file does not resemble previous releases of
KRA data. Details on the KRA assessment and changes to the test can be
found at https://pd.kready.org/r4kmaryland."><meta property="og:description" content="As of 2018-19, students who are not scored (NS) in all items
