#'
#' The Maryland School Survey was administered for the first time in spring 2019
#' to students and educators. It is online only, in English and Spanish for
#' students. Student participants were from Elementary (Grade 5), Middle (grades
#' 6-8), and High (grades 9-11), and all instructional staff were eligible. The
#' student participation rate was 69.9 percent overall, and the educator participation
#' rate was 76.9 percent.
#'
#' There were four domains and ten topics for students, and five domains and
#' eleven topics for educators. Survey results ranged from 1-10, with 10 being
#' most favorable and 1 being least favorable. Schools with fewer than 10
#' respondents overall or in any topic were excluded from relevant district
#' averages. Cells with an asterisk (*) denote less than 10 students or
#' educators in the summary group. Consequently, all data for that group are
#' suppressed. Survey results are included as an indicator of School Quality and
#' Student Success in the Maryland School Report Card (10 of 100 points: 7 from
#' the student survey, 3 from the educator survey).
#'
#' Student respondent summary groups include: Students with Disabilities (SWD)
#' ("Special Education Services" in MSDE file): Indicates students who have
#' current Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) and are receiving special
#' education services. English Learner (EL): English Learners, students who have
#' a primary or home language other than English and have been assessed as
#' having limited or no ability to understand, speak, or read English.
#' Economically Disadvantaged (ED): Indicates students who have been identified
#' as enrolled in a direct certification program. Direct certification is based
#' on a student's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Homeless,
#' Foster care, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) status. ED is

#' @title MSDE Kindergarten Readiness Assessment (KRA) results for Baltimore City Public Schools (SY 2019-2020)
#' @description As of 2018-19, students who are not scored (NS) in all items
#'   still receive a composite score and readiness level. NS is applied when an
#'   item requires demonstration of a skill (e.g., hopping), and the child is
#'   not able to respond due to a disability that restricts or prevents
#'   participating in the skill being assessed. A NS rating would not be
#'   appropriate when the response to the item reflects a child's functioning at
#'   an earlier developmental level and their ability to respond is not affected
#'   by a disability; in this instance the appropriate rating would be “0” since
#'   the child could access the item, but did not demonstrate the skill. See
#'   MSDE: KRA 2018-19 Technical Report, January 2019. Consistent with MSDE's
#'   reporting, aggregates exclude students with some incomplete items, and
#'   include students with not scorable (NS) items. Missing values include data
#'   that has been suppressed due to a group size of less than 10 students.
#'
#'   Children whose readiness skills and behaviors are "approaching" or
#'   "emerging" overall require instructional support to be successful in
#'   kindergarten and beyond. Reports of KRA data prior to the 2018-19
#'   administration have readiness level assigned for each of the four domains
#'   (Literacy, Math, Social Foundations, and Physical Development). Since last
#'   year's administration, readiness levels are no longer reported for
#'   individual domains, and only an overall or composite readiness level is
#'   reported. This is why this data file does not resemble previous releases of
#'   KRA data. Details on the KRA assessment and changes to the test can be
#'   found at https://pd.kready.org/r4kmaryland.

#' @title Accountability data (SY 2019)
#' @description The Maryland State Department of Education is required to report
#'   "accountability data" under the 2015 federal Every Student Succeeds Act
#'   (ESSA). Maryland's plan for an accountability system that complies with the
#'   ESSA was approved by the U.S. Department of Education in early 2018.
#'   Overall, The accountability system has two parts: academic indicators,
#'   which make up 65 possible points in the system, and measures of school
#'   quality and student success, which are 35 possible points.  The star rating
#'   and total points are summary measures based on a broad selection of
#'   performance indicators to measure how schools are doing.
#'
#'   Detailed data is available for download through the MSDE website. Howard
#'   County Public School System (HCPSS) provides an accessible explanation of
#'   the accountability data on their website:
