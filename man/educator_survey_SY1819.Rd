\description{
The Maryland School Survey was administered for the first time in spring 2019
to students and educators. It is online only, in English and Spanish for
students. Student participants were from Elementary (Grade 5), Middle (grades
6-8), and High (grades 9-11), and all instructional staff were eligible. The
student participation rate was 69.9 percent overall, and the educator participation
rate was 76.9 percent.

\details{
There were four domains and ten topics for students, and five domains and
eleven topics for educators. Survey results ranged from 1-10, with 10 being
most favorable and 1 being least favorable. Schools with fewer than 10
respondents overall or in any topic were excluded from relevant district
averages. Cells with an asterisk (*) denote less than 10 students or
educators in the summary group. Consequently, all data for that group are
suppressed. Survey results are included as an indicator of School Quality and
Student Success in the Maryland School Report Card (10 of 100 points: 7 from
the student survey, 3 from the educator survey).
