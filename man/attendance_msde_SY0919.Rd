\description{
Attendance data from the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE). Raw
CSV data files with the full state enrollment data are available in the
\code{inst/extdata} folder. Any percent variables with a value of 95 percent
should be interpreted as equivalent at or above 95 percent. Any percent
variables with a value of 5 percent should be interpreted as equivalent to at
or below 5 percent. Chronic absenteeism data is not available prior to 2018
when the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (passed in 2015) went into effect
and Maryland began to include the chronic absenteeism rate in the state's
annual academic report cards. Variable definitions are based on the
\href{https://reportcard.msde.maryland.gov/Definitions/Index}{definitions from the MSDE website}.
