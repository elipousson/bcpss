\description{
The Maryland School Survey was administered for the first time in spring 2019
to students and educators. It is online only, in English and Spanish for
students. Student participants were from Elementary (Grade 5), Middle (grades
6-8), and High (grades 9-11), and all instructional staff were eligible. The
student participation rate was 69.9 percent overall, and the educator
participation rate was 76.9 percent.

\details{
There were four domains and ten topics for students, and five domains and
eleven topics for educators. Survey results ranged from 1-10, with 10 being
most favorable and 1 being least favorable. Schools with fewer than 10
respondents overall or in any topic were excluded from relevant district
averages. Cells with an asterisk (*) denote less than 10 students or
educators in the summary group. Consequently, all data for that group are
suppressed. Survey results are included as an indicator of School Quality and
Student Success in the Maryland School Report Card (10 of 100 points: 7 from
the student survey, 3 from the educator survey).

Student respondent summary groups include: Students with Disabilities (SWD)
("Special Education Services" in MSDE file): Indicates students who have
current Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) and are receiving special
education services. English Learner (EL): English Learners, students who have
a primary or home language other than English and have been assessed as
having limited or no ability to understand, speak, or read English.
Economically Disadvantaged (ED): Indicates students who have been identified
as enrolled in a direct certification program. Direct certification is based
on a student's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Homeless,
Foster care, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) status. ED is
the new terminology used to refer to students historically identified as
low-income or Free and Reduced Meals (FARMS) students under the Every Student
Succeeds Act (ESSA).
